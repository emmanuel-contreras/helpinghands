# helpinghands

This app allows users with a task to find helpers who have the skills to complete that task. Requesters create an account and can submit tasks they need help on. Helpers create an account and list their skills and interests, as requesters submit tasks, helpers will be notified if the requester has requested their help. The helper can then accept or decline the request. Additionally, helpers can request to be helpers.
